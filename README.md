PART 3 - TRAINING THE SEQ2SEQ MODEL

PART 4 - TESTING THE SEQ2SEQ MODEL

# Description

The training time would take about 50 days when I started running this model on my own computer CPU.
(It will vary depending on the performance of your computer.)
Instead of dealing with this, I suggest you run it on google colab.

You can access the notebook with Google Colab Cloud Training File for GPU.

In this tutorial, we explore a fun and interesting use-case of recurrent sequence-to-sequence models. We will train a simple chatbot using movie scripts from the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus.
